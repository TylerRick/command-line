# based on sedml from http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/2008/04/26/sed-multi-line-search-and-replace/,
# but this version lets you operate on a stream (pipe the input into and the output out of this command) rather than operating on a file 
# Examples:
#   cat file | sedml 's/a/A/g'
#   sedml 's/a/A/g' <file
#
#   # Turn a \n-delimited list into a single-line, ,-delimited list
#   ... | sort | sedml 's/\n/,/g'

cat - | sed -n '
# if the first line copy the pattern to the hold buffer
1h
# if not the first line then append the pattern to the hold buffer
1!H
# if the last line then ...
$ {
        # copy from the hold to the pattern buffer
        g
        # do the search and replace
        '"$1"'
        # print
        p
}
