# select files in nautilus
# invoke "Rename in Vim" command
# it saves a copy of the original file list with original filenames, and opens another copy for you to make edits to

# open up the original list beside it with modifiable off and sync on (like vimdiff), so you can compare new to originals
# esp important if moving lines around to double check that you didn't create an off-by-1 bug
# (see how fugitive plugin works)

# make edits
# save file list

# compares originals to new, line by line
# if line count differs, error
# ??if Levenshtein/edit difference is high, give warning?
# renames are applied

# leave a line blank (cc in vim) to delete it?
# you can also swap filenames with another file by exchanging their lines
#   this script needs to be smart enough to move to temp filename first to avoid conflicts during swap
