# Kind of grep but shows or doesn't show the entire input depending on whether there is a match rather than showing only matching (or non-matching if -v) *lines*.
#
# Example:
# echo -e '1\nboring\n3' | silence_if_match '^bor\w+g'
#
# If you know the output of a job is useless (not worth reading) if it contains a certain string, you can pipe the output from it in your crontab to something like this:
#   silence_if_match '0 ready to send'

pattern = ARGV[0]
input = STDIN.read
match = input.lines.detect do |line|
  line =~ /#{pattern}/
end

if match
  # silence
else
  puts input 
end
