# Kind of grep but shows or doesn't show the entire input depending on whether there is a match rather than showing only matching (or non-matching if -v) *lines*.
#
# Example:
# If you only want to see output from your cron if there are warnings or errors, you might want to pipe the command through this:
#   silence_unless_match 'warning|error'
#
# Example:
# > echo -e '1\nwarning\n3' | silence_unless_match ^warning
# 1
# warning
# 3

pattern = ARGV[0]
input = STDIN.read
match = input.lines.detect do |line|
  line =~ /#{pattern}/
end

unless match
  # silence
else
  puts input 
end
