Usage: #{File.basename($0)} file.zip

Exits with 0 if the contents of the zip file are all contained within a single directory.
Exits with 1 if the contents of the zip file, when extracted, would clutter your working directory with a bunch (>1) of files/directories because whoever created the zip was an idiot and didn't follow the considerate practice of making zip files that, when extracted, leave you with a directory named the same as the zip (except without the .zip extension).
