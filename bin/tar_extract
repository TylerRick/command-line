Usage: #{File.basename($0)} file.tar

Extracts tar file normally (tar -xf file.tar) if the contents of the tar file are all contained within a single directory.

Otherwise* creates a new directory with the same name as the tar file and extracts the contents into that new directory.

* That is, if the contents of the tar file, when extracted, would clutter your working directory with a bunch (>1) of files/directories because whoever created the tar was uninformed and didn't follow the considerate practice of making tar files that, when extracted, leave you with a directory named the same as the tar (except without the .tar extension).
