# Usage: ffind search_term
# Finds all files within the current directory that contain the string "search_term".
# Excludes .svn files automatically. 

# This didn't work so well:
#find . -not -regex ".*\.svn.*" -exec echo {} | grep "$1" \;

# This does the same thing but is hard to read:
#find .  \( -name "*.svn*" \) -o \( -name "*$1*" \) -exec echo {} \;

find .  \( -not -name "*.svn*" \) -and \( -name "*$1*" \) -exec echo {} \;
