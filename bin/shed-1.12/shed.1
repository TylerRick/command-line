.SH NAME
shed (Simple Hex EDitor)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shed
.I [OPTIONS] [FILE]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A simple hex editor with a pico-style interface.
.PP
Each line of the shed display represents one byte of the
file. Each lines consists of the offset of that byte from
the start of the file, the ascii value of the byte, and
then the byte's value in various bases. All values are
unsigned.
.PP
When a command asks you for input, entering a
zero-length string or pressing ^C will cancel the command.
When searching, entering a zero-length string will use the
previous search word, if one exists.
.PP
Note that there is no save key. This is because the
file is not loaded into memory, so when you edit it
the change is made directly to disk.
