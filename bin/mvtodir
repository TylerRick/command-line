Usage: mvtodir [options] <files...> <dir>

<dir> need not already exist; it will be created it if does not.

This is better than simply doing mkdir <dir>; mv <files...> <dir>, because that will try to move <dir> to itself.
mvtodir will detect if you accidentally give the dest dir as one of the sources (which will happen whenever you supply * for <files>) and will skip that, moving all other files, which is probably what you wanted...
(Besides, mvtodir is less to type).

Similar to this option from mv:
       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
                     move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY


Options:
--on-conflict=<arg>, where <arg> can be overwrite, ask, copy-to-subdir, or add-suffix

--create-subdir=<arg>, where <arg> can be all or on-conflict (default)

  mvtodir --create-subdir=all ./neat_file backups
  => backups/20090111T1329/neat_file
  mvtodir --create-subdir ./neat_file backups
  => backups/20090111T1400/neat_file
  ??

--create-subdir-style=<arg>, where <arg> can be 
  'now' (default): creates a subdirectory with the name taken from the 'now' command (the format of which can be configured with a ~/.now file?)
